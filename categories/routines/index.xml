      <description>My current daily workout, on top of the weights, I do cardio before/after or just during the day. I was getting up at 5:30am and doing cardio then doing weights in the evening after work. I am now doing all of my cardio and weights at 4:30 am before work. I also go for walks during lunch, usually 2 to 3 miles.
