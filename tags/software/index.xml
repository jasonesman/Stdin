      <description>Completed a couple of Pi Projects today. First was a Pi Musicbox player using some Bose speakers I picked up. The second was setting up PiHole and configuring it to use DOH (DNS over HTTPS) for my local lan. I really need to get rid of my ATT Uverse Gateway and get a good router/firewall in front of it.
PiHole The PiHole is an addblocker, but it does more. If you setup DOH (Dns over HTTPS) it secures your DNS from your local internet service tracking you.</description>

      <description>Getting rid of Google in my life has lead me back to Firefox. I started on the web with Netscape Navigator. I used this for years refusing to use Microsoft Explorer (Edge) on anything. That was till I was hit by the Google love bug. I bacame a fan boy of anything they put out, I was in the beta for Chrome, Google+, Hangouts etc. After all, Don&amp;rsquo;t be evil!</description>
