      <description>Completed a couple of Pi Projects today. First was a Pi Musicbox player using some Bose speakers I picked up. The second was setting up PiHole and configuring it to use DOH (DNS over HTTPS) for my local lan. I really need to get rid of my ATT Uverse Gateway and get a good router/firewall in front of it.
PiHole The PiHole is an addblocker, but it does more. If you setup DOH (Dns over HTTPS) it secures your DNS from your local internet service tracking you.</description>

      <description>NextCloud will replace both Google Photos, Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive. It will sync your devices and it will backup your photos. I have a lot of documents I need to move, i want to get them from all my devices, this makes it super easy. Yes Nextcloud offers a lot more but this is what i&#39;m going to use it for. It is secure when you follow their best practices.</description>
